<p>
  Rock-paper-scissors (also known as paper, scissors, stone or other variants) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.

  These shapes are:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    "rock" (a closed fist)
  </li>

  <li>
    "paper (a flat hand)"
  </li>

  <li>
    "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)
  </li>

</ul>
